# Course
- Java Mastery Course (paid) - https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-java-mastery-series
- I personally took this course 3 years ago and it is a great place for beginners to start.
- Learning Java's foundations FIRST before trying to make plugins is critical.
- It's organized well and Mosh is a great teacher. This is not a paid endorsement.
